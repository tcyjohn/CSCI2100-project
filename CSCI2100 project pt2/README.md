# CSCI2100A_24P2

Project2 Template for CUHK CSCI2100A Fall 2024

This is merely a template. You need to implement four classes related to storage and  an external merge sort algorithm.

In this project, you need to do the following tasks:

1. Emulate the hierarchy of memory storage in a computer system. Namely, the secondary storage and the buffer.
2. Implement an external merge sort algorithm to sort a large file that cannot be loaded into the buffer at once.
3. Modify the template to enable it to accept arguments from the command line.

You may modify the template as necessary, but ensure that your implementation includes the functionalities explicitly required by the template.

**You should write a README to tell TA how to run/compile your codes.**

If you find anything inappropriate or incorrect, please contact the TA via(1155204966@link.cuhk.edu.hk)
## Supported Languages

- Python**3**
- C++
- Java

**Note that python2 is deprecated and you should never use it in any new projects.**

## How to Run

Without exception, your program needs to support the following methods of execution.

### Python
python3 main.py input_file_name output_file_name

### C++
./binary input_file_name output_file_name

### Java
java main input_file_name output_file_name

**Additionally, your program must be capable of outputting the value of H.**
**For example**
```
H: 11223344.
